# librenms_devicegroup (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# create a static device group with a single device using the computed resource id
resource "librenms_devicegroup" "my_group" {
  name = "my_group"
  type = "static"

  devices = [
    librenms_device.device.id,
  ]
}

# create a dynamic device group with devices that have a sysDescr containing "cloud"
resource "librenms_devicegroup" "my_dynamic_group" {
  name        = "my_dynamic_group"
  description = "includes devices with sysDescr containing 'cloud'"
  type        = "dynamic"

  rules = {
    "condition" : "AND",
    "rules" : [
      {
        "id" : "devices.sysDescr",
        "field" : "devices.sysDescr",
        "operator" : "contains",
        "value" : "cloud"
      }
    ]
  }

  # complex, nested rulesets can be configured using rules_json.
  # rules_json = jsonencode({....})
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The device group name.
- `type` (String) The device group type, [`dynamic`, `static`].

### Optional

- `description` (String) The device group description.
- `devices` (List of Number) The list of device IDs in the group. This is only applicable for static device groups.
- `rules` (Attributes) The rules for dynamic device groups. This is only applicable for dynamic device groups.Use this field for simpler rule definitions. Use `rules_json` for more complex, deeper nested rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))
- `rules_json` (String) The rules for dynamic device groups, in serialized JSON format. This is only applicable for dynamic device groups.Use this field as a workaround if your rules have 2 or more levels of recursion.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The unique numeric identifier of the LibreNMS device group.

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `condition` (String) The condition to apply to the rules [`AND`, `OR`].
- `rules` (Attributes List) The list of rules to apply to the device group. Each rule is a nested object with its own attributes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--rules))

Optional:

- `joins` (List of List of String) The list of joins to apply to the rules. Each join is a list of strings.

<a id="nestedatt--rules--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.rules`

Required:

- `field` (String) The field to match against, e.g. `devices.sysDescr`.
- `id` (String) The field id to match against, e.g. `devices.sysDescr`. In practice, this seems to be the same value as `field`.
- `operator` (String) The operator to use for matching, e.g. `equal`, `contains`. Check the LibreNMS UI for a full list.
- `value` (String) The string value to match against the field.
