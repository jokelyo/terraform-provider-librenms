## LibreNMS Rule Definitions

Due to the complicated structure of the rulesets,
I would recommend initially configuring the builder
ruleset in the LibreNMS UI and then exporting from
the API to get the correct JSON format.

Example to get formatted builder output from an existing rule:
```shell
   curl -H "X-Auth-Token: token" \
     https://librenms.mydomain.com/api/v0/rules/2 | \
     jq '.rules.[0].builder | fromjson'
```

You can also just use the serialized JSON string
as it's natively represented in the LibreNMS API output,
but the readability is worse:

```terraform
builder = "{\"condition\": \"AND\", ....}"
```
